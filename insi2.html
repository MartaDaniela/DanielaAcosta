We particularly liked the images of people being productive since we hoped our app would help UCSD student find spaces that helped them focus and be productive. We also enjoyed the minimalistic feeling of these images and hoped to include this clean and simple aesthetic in our app. </p>
        <p>With the help our or mood-board, our initial style guide included a soft, robin egg blue color with dark grey for accents, paired with standard white and black colors. For our typeface we chose Helvetica (ADA-Compliant) to ensure accessibility for all users. We felt this guide was closest to matching our idea of INSI having a simple, clean feel for most efficient use while still being lively and welcoming for users.</p>

        <h2>4.1 Lo-fi Prototype User Testing</h2>
        <h4>Goals</h4>
        <img  class="centered" src="images/INSI-imgs/LofiTestingGoals.png" width= "100%" height="100%">
        <p>For our Lo-fi prototype user testing we wanted to find out: </p>
        <ol>
          <li><p>The tradeoff between length and detail in our onboarding process</p></li>
          <li><p>If our users understood the concept of boards</p></li>
          <li><p>How users navigate to various features such as favorites, collections, and study spaces</p></li>
        </ol>
        <h4>User Testing</h4>
        <div class="row centered">
          <div class="col-lg-6">
            <img class="user-test-imgs" src="images/INSI-imgs/AngieInterview.png" width= "80%" height="100%">
          </div>
          <div class="col-lg-6">

          </div>
        </div>
        <p>We conducted our user testing through zoom and utilized its screen recording capabilities track and collect data how users interacted with our prototype. Afterwards we asked participants follow-up questions regarding different aspects of our app.</p>
        <h4>Insights</h4>
        <img  class="centered" src="images/INSI-imgs/LoFi-Insights.png" width= "100%" height="100%">
        <p>By analyzing our data we found that people generally favored shorter onboarding processes but there were also some who were willing to tradeoff length for details. Interviewees also had a correct general sense of what boards meant in the context of our app, but they were still relatively confused. In addition, we found that people might accidentally click on the wrong button if favorites and settings are too close.</p>
        <h4>Iterations</h4>
        <img  class="centered" src="images/INSI-imgs/Lofi-Iterations.png" width= "100%" height="100%">
        <p>We decided to keep preference questions to at most five. To help make boards more clear, we renamed it to collections so that its purpose and function is more intuitive for users. Also, instead of having favorites and settings icons side by side, we created new buttons to edit preferences and to access favorites. We also introduced possible search keywords in search bar to signify what users can search for </p>

        <img src="images/INSI-imgs/Final Style Guide.png" width= "100%" height="100%">
        <p>Our final style guide is nearly the same as our initial style guide. We added a gray color for when a button is being hovered. Light blue is for headers and for the inside of objects, the light black is for icons, text, and borders, the white is for the background, and the black is for accents. Our typeface is still Helvetica which is bolded for the headers and is regular for the body text.</p>

        <img  class="centered" src="images/INSI-imgs/HiFiTestingGoals.png" width= "100%" height="100%">
        <p>We wanted to hear what people thought of our renaming of 'board' to 'collecion,' the new buttons for editing preference quizzes and the favorites section, and our addition of the search keywords in the search bar.</p>

        <img  class="centered" src="images/INSI-imgs/Hi-Fi-Findings.png" width= "100%" height="100%">
        <p>We discovered that users enoyed the app's appearance since it was fun and bright. They did say that it was difficult to tell the difference between the favorites page and collection page. Because of the ambigious signifiers, it was difficult for them to add and delete study spaces on the collection page.</p>

          <p>The creating and deleting features in the collection page weren’t intuitive for some users. We changed the location of the creating button (i.e. '+') to the top right corner of the screen and have the delete button as three dots. We hoped to utilize app conventions for creating and deleting symbols to improve the intuitiveness of our app.</p>
